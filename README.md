# 2017-VCM-Medical-Database
The VCM Medical Database Application is developed for use during the annual Vermont City Marathon to track athletes receiving medical services during the event. This iteration is a web-based application which will run on a local server during the event, and be accessed from laptops connected to a secure wireless network, set up the day of the event in the main medical tent.  Others may find this application valuable for similar events.  Special thanks to Tenzin Lhakhang, who has been the Secret Sauce for this application since it's first inception, many years ago!
